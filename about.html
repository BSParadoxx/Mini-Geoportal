                An innovative platform for geospatial exploration and analysis. This web-based application features two interactive web maps powered by the Leaflet library. Users can switch between three base maps which are OpenStreetMap, Satellite Imagery, and OpenCycleMap and access real-time environmental data layers such as soil moisture, cloud cover, wind direction, air quality, and weather information fetched via APIs. Additionally, it provides detailed geospatial datasets of Nepal, including rivers, hydropower plants above 1MW capacity, transmission lines, airports, and administrative boundaries. Advanced filtering options allow users to explore data by province, district, or specific attributes. Additionally, users can upload their own data to the portal, where a buffer is created for the uploaded data, and the results can be downloaded as a .geojson file. The portal also allows users to download already available shapefiles uploaded in the system.
